# JD Analysis Framework

## Overview
This framework helps systematically analyze job descriptions to identify key requirements, prioritize preparation areas, and align your background with the role.

## Analysis Structure

### 1. Role Classification
- **Level**: Junior, Mid, Senior, Staff, Principal, Leadership
- **Type**: IC (Individual Contributor) vs Management
- **Team**: Backend, Frontend, Full-stack, Infrastructure, Data, ML, etc.
- **Focus**: Product, Platform, Tools, Research, etc.

### 2. Required Skills Extraction

#### Technical Skills (Must-Have)
- **Programming Languages**: List all mentioned, note emphasis (e.g., "strong Python")
- **Frameworks/Tools**: Specific technologies explicitly required
- **Systems Knowledge**: Databases, cloud platforms, architecture patterns
- **Domain Expertise**: ML, distributed systems, security, etc.

#### Technical Skills (Nice-to-Have)
- **Bonus Technologies**: Technologies mentioned as "plus" or "preferred"
- **Adjacent Skills**: Related but not core requirements

#### Soft Skills
- **Communication**: Collaboration, documentation, presentation
- **Leadership**: Mentoring, decision-making, influence
- **Problem Solving**: Analytical thinking, creativity, debugging
- **Work Style**: Autonomy, ownership, pace, ambiguity tolerance

### 3. Responsibility Analysis

#### Core Responsibilities
Extract and categorize:
- **Build**: What you'll build/create
- **Maintain**: What you'll own/support
- **Collaborate**: Who you'll work with and how
- **Improve**: Systems/processes you'll optimize
- **Lead**: What you'll drive or decide

#### Scope & Impact
- **Team Size**: Working alone, small team, large org
- **User Scale**: Startup scale vs enterprise scale
- **Business Impact**: Revenue, user experience, infrastructure, etc.

### 4. Experience Requirements

#### Years & Background
- **Total Experience**: Stated years required
- **Relevant Experience**: Domain-specific experience needed
- **Education**: Degree requirements (if any)
- **Previous Roles**: What roles they're recruiting from

#### Project Complexity
- **Scale Indicators**: Users, requests, data volume, team size
- **Technical Depth**: System design, architecture, performance
- **Problem Complexity**: Ambiguity, novel problems, research

### 5. Company Context Clues

#### Team Stage
- **Build Mode**: "Building from scratch", "greenfield", "0 to 1"
- **Scale Mode**: "Scale", "optimize", "millions of users"
- **Maintain Mode**: "Support", "maintain", "legacy"
- **Transform Mode**: "Migrate", "modernize", "refactor"

#### Team Culture Signals
- **Process**: Agile, iterative, planning mentions
- **Quality**: Testing, code review, documentation emphasis
- **Collaboration**: Cross-functional, paired programming
- **Learning**: Mentorship, growth, learning mentions

### 6. Red Flags & Questions

#### Potential Concerns
- **Vague Requirements**: Too generic or contradictory requirements
- **Unrealistic Expectations**: Too many skills, too senior for level
- **Missing Information**: No team size, tech stack, or growth info
- **Culture Signals**: "Fast-paced" (overtime?), "wear many hats" (scope creep?)

#### Questions to Ask
Based on analysis, prepare questions about:
- Unclear responsibilities
- Technology choices
- Team structure
- Success metrics
